You can customize the progress barâ€™s size, color, and background by overriding the styles in uploader component. Refer to the following example.

{% tab template="uploader/progressbar", sourceFiles="app/**/*.ts,default.html,index.css" %}

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: 'default.html',
    styleUrls: ['index.css']
})

export class AppComponent {

    public path: Object = {
        saveUrl: 'https://ej2.syncfusion.com/services/api/uploadbox/Save',
