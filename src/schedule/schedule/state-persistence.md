# Set state persistence

State persistence allowed Scheduler to retain the `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. This action is handled through the `enablePersistence` property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values of the scheduler component will be retained even after refreshing the page.

> **Note**: Scheduler `id` is essential to set state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% tab template="schedule/default", sourceFiles="app/**/*.ts,app/index.css", iframeHeight="588px" %}

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { EventSettingsModel, TimeScaleModel, DayService, WeekService, WorkWeekService, MonthService, AgendaService } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule';
import { scheduleData } from './datasource';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  providers: [DayService, WeekService, WorkWeekService, MonthService, AgendaService],
  // specifies the template string for the Schedule component
  template: `<ejs-schedule id="schedule" width='100%' height='550px' [selectedDate]="selectedDate" [eventSettings]="eventSettings" [enablePersistence]="enablePersistence"> </ejs-schedule>`
})
export class AppComponent {
    public selectedDate: Date = new Date(2018, 1, 15);
    public eventSettings: EventSettingsModel = { dataSource: scheduleData };
    public enablePersistence: Boolean = true;
 }
```
