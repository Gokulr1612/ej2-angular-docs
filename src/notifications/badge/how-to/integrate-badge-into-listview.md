# Integrate badge into Listview

The badges can be integrated with the `listview` component to indicate new notification with colour based on priority.

In the following sample, `default` badges are used and there is no need to customize the
badge size. The component will automatically adjust the size based on the container element.

{% tab template="badge/listview", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="app/**/*.ts", index.css"  %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}
